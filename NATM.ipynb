The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\\\\n    much of the net community has settled. Please DON\\\\\\'T bring them up again\\\\n    unless there\\\\\\'s something truly new to be discussed. The net can\\\\\\'t set\\\\n    public policy, that\\\\\\'s what your representatives are for.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS\\\\n\\\\n    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints\\\\n    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\\\\n    microfilm.\\\\n\\\\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\\\\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\\\\\\'s vintage hardware (like\\\\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\\\\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\\\\n    from.\\\\n\\\\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\\\\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\\\\n    sheet design.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\\\\\\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\\\\n\\\\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\\\\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\\\\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\\\\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\\\\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\\\\n    in a mission.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\\\\n\\\\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\\\\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\\\\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\\\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\\\n\\\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\\\n    pursue are:\\\\n\\\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\\\\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo\\\\\\'s launch,\\\\n    \"Showdown at Pad 39-B,\" by Robert G.

Studies\\\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\\\n\\\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\\\n\\\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\\\n\\\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\\\n\\\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\\\n\\\\t  Shuttle sources:\\\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\\\n\\\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\\\n\\\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\\\n\\\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\\\n    do at the present time.\\\\n\\\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\\\n    Shuttle\\\\\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\\\\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\\\n\\\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\\\n    you\\\\\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\\\n\\\\n    References:\\\\n\\\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\\\n\\\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\\\n    team\\\\\\'s medical/forensic report.\\\\n\\\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\\\n\\\\n    You can\\\\\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\\\n    because it can\\\\\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\\\n\\\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\\\\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\\\n    spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\\\n\\\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\\\n\\\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\\\\\'t\\\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\\\n\\\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\\\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\\\\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\\\\n    sci.astro.\\\\n\\\\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\\\n\\\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\\\n\\\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\\\n\\\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\\\n\\\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\\\n\\\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\\\n\\\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\\\n\\\\tin second stage.\"\\\\n\\\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\\\\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\\\\\'ll try\\\\n    to interpret.\\\\n\\\\n    1)\\\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\\\n\\\\n    2)\\\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\\\n\\\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\\\n\\\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\\\n\\\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\\\n\\\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\\\tThis causes a little bit of\\\\n\\\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\\\n\\\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\\\n\\\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\\\\\'re about the\\\\n\\\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\\\n\\\\n    3)\\\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\\\n\\\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\\\n\\\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\\\n\\\\tthe case if we didn\\\\\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\\\n\\\\n    4)\\\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\\\n\\\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\\\n\\\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\\\n\\\\tcomplexity\").\\\\n\\\\n    5)\\\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\\\n\\\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\\\n\\\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\\\n\\\\n    6)\\\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\\\n\\\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\\\n\\\\n    7)\\\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\\\n\\\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\\\n\\\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\\\n\\\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\\\n\\\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\\\n\\\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\\\n\\\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\\\n\\\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\\\\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\\\\\'s.  (A side note: the\\\\n    Saturn V\\\\\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\\\\\'t ask me why -- I\\\\\\'m a Shuttle\\\\n    guy.)\\\\n\\\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\\\tHe added that the \"roll\\\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\\\n    array.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\\\n\\\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\\\n    for these viewers.\\\\n\\\\n    If you can\\\\\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\\\n    It\\\\\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\\\\\'t.\\\\n\\\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\\\n    are not being covered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\\\n\\\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\\\n\\\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\\\n\\\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\\\n\\\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\\\n\\\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\\\n\\\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tStation    VHF\\\\t   10m\\\\t   15m\\\\t   20m\\\\t  40m\\\\t 80m\\\\n\\\\t------\\\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\\\t-----\\\\n\\\\tW6FXN\\\\t 145.46\\\\n\\\\tK6MF\\\\t 145.585\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t 7.165\\\\t3.840\\\\n\\\\tWA3NAN\\\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\\\t3.860\\\\n\\\\tW5RRR\\\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\\\t3.850\\\\n\\\\tW6VIO\\\\t 224.04\\\\t\\\\t 21.340  14.270\\\\n\\\\tW6VIO\\\\t 224.04\\\\t\\\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\\\t3.840\\\\n\\\\tW1AW\\\\t\\\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\\\t3.990\\\\n\\\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\\\n\\\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

I\\\\\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\\\n\\\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\\\n\\\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\\\nthe space station.\\\\n\\\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\\\navailable funds.\\\\n\\\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\\\\\'s new technology\\\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\\\n\\\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\\\nconsider.\\\\n\\\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\\\n\\\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\\\nachieving that goal.\\\\n\\\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\\\n\\\\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\\\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\\\\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\\\\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\\\\n\\\\n\\'', '60237': \"b'Newsgroups: sci.space\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!rochester!dietz\\\\nFrom: dietz@cs.rochester.edu (Paul Dietz)\\\\nSubject: Re: nuclear waste\\\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr6.172224.2057@cs.rochester.edu>\\\\nOrganization: University of Rochester\\\\nReferences: <1pe8i8INNfoq@gap.caltech.edu> <1pp6reINNonl@phantom.gatech.edu> <844@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp>\\\\nDate: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 17:22:24 GMT\\\\n\\\\nIn article <844@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp> will@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp (William Reiken) writes:\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\tOk, so how about the creation of oil producing bacteria?

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\\\n\\\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\\\n\\\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\\\nof atmospheres.\\\\n\\\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\\\nand about 50 cm long.\\\\n\\\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\\\n\\\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\\\n\\\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\\\nto follow the projectiles.\\\\n\\\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\\\nI haven\\'t had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\\\n\\\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\\\n\\\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\\\n\\\\nDani Eder\\\\n\\\\n-- \\\\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37\\' N 86deg 43\\' W +100m alt.\\\\n\"', '60843': 'b\"Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu rec.arts.sf.science:5720 sci.space:60843\\\\nNewsgroups: rec.arts.sf.science,sci.space\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!magnesium.club.cc.cmu.edu!news.sei.cmu.edu!cis.ohio-state.edu!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!sdd.hp.com!caen!destroyer!cs.ubc.ca!newsserver.sfu.ca!rs5-annex3.sfu.ca!palmer\\\\nFrom: Leigh Palmer <palmer@sfu.ca>\\\\nSubject: Re: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?\\\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr17.053333.15696@sfu.ca>\\\\nX-Xxmessage-Id: <A7F4E4ADFD021C0B@rs5-annex3.sfu.ca>\\\\nX-Xxdate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 06:33:17 GMT\\\\nSender: news@sfu.ca\\\\nOrganization: Simon Fraser University\\\\nX-Useragent: Nuntius v1.1.1d17\\\\nReferences: <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET>\\\\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 05:33:33 GMT\\\\nLines: 15\\\\n\\\\nIn article <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET> James P.

It\\\\\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\\\nmaterials we can\\\\\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\\\nand it\\\\\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\\\\\'s heat \\\\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\\\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\\\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\\\\\'s a very minor \\\\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\\\n\\\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\\\\\'s likely too low to prevent\\\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\\\\\'s\\\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\\\n\\\\nWe don\\\\\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\\\\\'s because we don\\\\\\'t have to\\\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\\\\\'ll use the\\\\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\\\\ncenturies, if not much longer.\\\\n\\\\nLuna\\\\\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\\\\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\\\\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\\\\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\\\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\\\nconventional warfare again. There\\\\\\'s little glory in watching from a\\\\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

Was it political (i.e.\\\\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\\\\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\\\\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\\\\\\'s hair....  \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\\\\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\\\\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\\\\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\\\\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\\\\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\\\\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\\\\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\\\\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\\\\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\\\\nprepared if necessary.  \\\\n\\\\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\\\\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\\\\ngreat, if not, so it\\\\\\'s lost and no big deal.\\\\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\\\\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\\\\ndata even if they\\\\\\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\\\\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\\\\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\\\\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \\\\n\\\\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\\\\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\\\\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\\\\nthe primary mission.

However, the rumors\\\\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\\\n>seems more likely.\\\\n\\\\nYo Ken, let\\\\\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\\\noptions list. Today\\\\\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\\\nthat O\\\\\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\\\ntoday\\\\\\'s Times).\\\\n\\\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\\\noption are:\\\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\\\\\'s\\\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\\\\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\\\n     for the Air Force.\\\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\\\n     Partners\\\\\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\\\n     Vehicle).\\\\n\\\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\\\n\\\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\\\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\\\n\\\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\\\n     it visits.\\\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\\\n\\\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\\\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\\\nchanges.\\\\n\\\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\\\ncylinder that\\\\\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\\\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\\\n\\'', '61171': 'b\\'Path: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!rochester!udel!darwin.sura.net!howland.reston.ans.net!noc.near.net!das-news.harvard.edu!husc-news.harvard.edu!husc.harvard.edu!kkobayas\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.space\\\\nSubject: DC-X/Y/1 question\\\\nMessage-ID: <kkobayas.735613051@husc.harvard.edu>\\\\nFrom: kkobayas@husc8.harvard.edu (Ken Kobayashi)\\\\nDate: 24 Apr 93 00:57:31 GMT\\\\nKeywords: DC-X\\\\nNntp-Posting-Host: husc8.harvard.edu\\\\nLines: 17\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n   I\\\\\\'ve been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and I\\\\nhave one small question.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\'.\\\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\\\\\'s\\\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\\\\\'s\\\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\\\\\'unit\\\\\\' cost\\\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\\\n  \\\\nBut back to Brian\\\\\\'s questions:\\\\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\\\\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\\\n  \\\\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\\\\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\\\\\'t piggy back upon\\\\nsomeone else\\\\\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\\\nlaunch.  That\\\\\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\\\\\'t think the\\\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\\\nand no, I don\\\\\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\\\nidiot?)\\\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\\\\\'s in a low\\\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\\\\\'s the time\\\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\\\\\'t heard of any serious funding\\\\nfor this, but I\\\\\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\\\n  \\\\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\\\nmy guest.  I don\\\\\\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t THINK I do...).\\\\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\\\\n\\\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\\\n\\'', '61215': 'b\\'Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu sci.space:61215 sci.astro:35001\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!magnesium.club.cc.cmu.edu!news.sei.cmu.edu!cis.ohio-state.edu!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!howland.reston.ans.net!agate!darkstar.UCSC.EDU!darkstar!steinly\\\\nFrom: steinly@topaz.ucsc.edu (Steinn Sigurdsson)\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.space,sci.astro\\\\nSubject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\\\n    for the planet Venus. \\\\n\\\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\\\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\\\n\\\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\\\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\\\\\'\\\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\\\n\\\\n        The Soviet probes\\\\\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\\\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\\\n    VENERAs\\\\\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\\\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\\\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\\\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\\\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\\\n\\\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\\\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\\\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\\\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\\\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\\\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\\\\\' \\\\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\\\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\\\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\\\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\\\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\\\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\\\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\\\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\\\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\\\n\\\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\\\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\\\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\\\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\\\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\\\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\\\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\\\n    across, due to Venus\\\\\\' very dense atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\\\\\' \\\\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\\\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\\\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\\\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\\\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\\\n\\\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\\\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\\\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\\\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\\\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\\\n\\\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\\\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\\\\\'s\\\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\\\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\\\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\\\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\\\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\\\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\\\n\\\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\\\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\\\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\\\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\\\n\\\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\\\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\\\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\\\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\\\n\\\\n        Venus by Balloon\\\\n\\\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\\\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\\\\\'s mantle of \\\\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\\\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\\\\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\\\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\\\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\\\n\\\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\\\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\\\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\\\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\\\n\\\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\\\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\\\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\\\n\\\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\\\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\\\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\\\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\\\n\\\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\\\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\\\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\\\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\\\n    encounter.\\\\n\\\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\\\n    Japan\\\\\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\\\n    comet, while Japan\\\\\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\\\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\\\n\\\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\\\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\\\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\\\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\\\n\\\\n        The Soviets\\\\\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\\\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\\\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\\\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\\\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\\\n    location of the comet\\\\\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\\\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\\\n\\\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\\\n    successfully arrived. \\\\n\\\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\\\n    permeated the planet\\\\\\'s atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\\\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\\\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\\\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\\\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\\\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\\\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\\\n    had thought the planet\\\\\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\\\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\\\n\\\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\\\n    journey.  The layer\\\\\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\\\n\\\\n        Early in the first balloon\\\\\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\\\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\\\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\\\n    miles) above the surface. \\\\n\\\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\\\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\\\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\\\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\\\\\'s \\\\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\\\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\\\n\\\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\\\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\\\n    returned during the lander\\\\\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\\\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\\\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\\\n\\\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\\\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\\\\\'s results\\\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\\\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\\\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\\\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\\\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\\\n    over the last seven years.\\\\n\\\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\\\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\\\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\\\n\\\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\\\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\\\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\\\n    miles) towards the surface.\\\\n\\\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\\\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\\\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\\\n    through the balloon\\\\\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\\\\\'s nephelometer \\\\n    failed to function.\\\\n\\\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\\\n    Terra\\\\\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\\\\\'s resting place was smoother\\\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\\\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\\\\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\\\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\\\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\\\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\\\n\\\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\\\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\\\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\\\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\\\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\\\n    hours.\\\\n\\\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\\\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\\\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\\\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\\\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\\\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\\\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\\\n\\\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\\\n\\\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\\\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\\\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\\\n    the early 1990s.\\\\n\\\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\\\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\\\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\\\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\\\\\'s \\\\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\\\n    the VEGA balloons\\\\\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\\\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\\\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\\\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\\\n\\\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\\\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\\\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\\\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\\\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\\\n    Mars\\\\\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\\\n\\\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\\\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\\\n\\\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\\\n\\\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\\\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\\\n\\\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\\\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\\\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\\\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\\\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\\\n\\\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\\\n    make money.  \\\\n\\\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\\\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\\\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\\\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\\\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\\\n\\\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\\\n\\\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\\\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\\\n\\\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\\\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\\\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\\\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\\\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\\\n    probe\\\\\\'s primary target\\\\\\'s major moons in 1610.\\\\n\\\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\\\\\'s first planetary\\\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\\\n    planet\\\\\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\\\n\\\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\\\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\\\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\\\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\\\n\\\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\\\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\\\n    to study Venus\\\\\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\\\n\\\\n        Humans on Venus      \\\\n\\\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\\\n    Earth\\\\\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\\\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\\\n    to speed up the planet\\\\\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\\\n    if not millennia.\\\\n\\\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\\\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\\\n\\\\n        Bibliography -\\\\n\\\\n         Barsukov, V.

For\\\\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\\\\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\\\\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\\\\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we\\'re out of luck there); or\\\\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\\\\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\\\\nby necessity, must choose.                    \\\\n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \\\\nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\\\\nof congresspersons\\' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\\\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\\\ncongressperson\\'s staff review a bill.\\\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\\\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\\\\nand politicians.\\\\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\\\\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\\\\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\\\\nSociety).\\\\n\\\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\\\n\"', '61276': 'b\\'Newsgroups: sci.space\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!crabapple.srv.cs.cmu.edu!18084TM@msu.edu\\\\nFrom: 18084TM@msu.edu (Tom)\\\\nSubject: Vandalizing the sky\\\\nMessage-ID: <C650Ap.MJv.1@cs.cmu.edu>\\\\nX-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest\\\\nSender: news+@cs.cmu.edu\\\\nOrganization: [via International Space University]\\\\nOriginal-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU\\\\nDistribution: sci\\\\nDate: Tue, 27 Apr 1993 10:02:44 GMT\\\\nApproved: bboard-news_gateway\\\\nLines: 47\\\\n\\\\nWm Hathaway comments;\\\\n>I\\\\\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly\\\\n>practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for\\\\n>research activities by professional astronomers.

You mention the age-old desire to\\\\nsomehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment\\\\nof that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded\\\\nby the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be\\\\nsky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,\\\\nour descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts\\\\nthat others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,\\\\nnot upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all\\\\nof the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach\\\\nthat goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the\\\\n\\\\\\'pristine\\\\\\' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally\\\\nunreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern\\\\nsculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t think there\\\\\\'s any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,\\\\njust because it has changed the way we strive.\\\\n\\\\nBTW, there are places that people haven\\\\\\'t fouled.

The\\\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\\\n\\\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\\\n\\\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\\\n\\\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\\\nManagement System.\\\\n\\\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\\\n\\\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\\\n\\\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\\\n\\\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\\\npropulsion systems.\\\\n\\\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\\\n\\\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\\\noperations costs, he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\\\n\\\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\\\nattitude.\\\\n\\\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\\\\\'Connor\\\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\\\n\\\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\\\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\\\n\\\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\\\ncommand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\\\nAdministrator.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\\\nhand-picked program office.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\\\nelement of the current program.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xa5 Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\\\n\\\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\\\n\\\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\\\nand ground operations.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\\\\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\\\nbe held May 3.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\\\\\'Connor will take over the\\\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\\\n\\\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\\\n\\\\nApril 26\\\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\\\n\\\\nApril 27\\\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\\\n\\\\nMay 3\\\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\\\n\\\\nMay 15\\\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\\\n\\\\nJune 7\\\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\\\\n \\\\n\\'', '61316': 'b\"Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu sci.space:61316 sci.astro:35110 sci.space.shuttle:12919 alt.sci.planetary:1243\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!magnesium.club.cc.cmu.edu!news.sei.cmu.edu!cis.ohio-state.edu!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!usc!elroy.jpl.nasa.gov!kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov!baalke\\\\nFrom: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.space,sci.astro,sci.space.shuttle,alt.sci.planetary\\\\nSubject: Space Calendar - 04/27/93\\\\nDate: 27 Apr 1993 21:20 UT\\\\nOrganization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory\\\\nLines: 152\\\\nDistribution: world\\\\nMessage-ID: <27APR199321203902@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov>\\\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\\\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \\\\n\\\\n     The Space Calendar is updated monthly and the latest copy is available\\\\nat ames.arc.nasa.gov in the /pub/SPACE/FAQ.

Rather than being able to use different tools  \\\\ntogether in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  \\\\nmuch time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  \\\\ntools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  \\\\nrather than what it means to have attained it.\\\\n\\\\nWhat we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  \\\\nwe choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  \\\\nhighly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  \\\\nspecialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   \\\\nThe use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  \\\\nrequiring a very short learning phase and practically no  \\\\nuser-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  \\\\npossibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  \\\\nmuch about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   \\\\nBy building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  \\\\nto draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  \\\\nparticular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  \\\\nresults, and combine information from many different sources.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  \\\\nMolecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   \\\\nWhile many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  \\\\nmotivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  \\\\nsystem which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  \\\\ndata and daily work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy NeXTSTEP?\\\\n\\\\nWhat else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  \\\\nobject-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  \\\\nhighly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  \\\\nNS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  \\\\nof hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  \\\\navailable.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  \\\\nhave little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  \\\\nGUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  \\\\nmass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer\\\\\\'s nightmare (either despite,  \\\\nor more probably because of, OLE).\\\\n\\\\nIn order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  \\\\nsuch an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  \\\\ntogether a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  \\\\n\"Hyper-knowledge\" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  \\\\nminimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  \\\\nenvironment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  \\\\nbest developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  \\\\ncan/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  \\\\nan \"AVS\"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMailing list and Anonymous ftp\\\\n\\\\nIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,  \\\\nyou are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.de\\\\nAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and  \\\\nsoon available (anonymous ftp).\\\\nFor questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.de\\\\n\\\\nAcknowledgments\\\\n\\\\nThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has  \\\\nconsented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and  \\\\nanonymous ftp services.\\\\n\\\\nRick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.de>\\\\nGeorg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de>\\\\n\\'', '61344': 'b\"Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu sci.astro:35138 sci.space:61344\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!magnesium.club.cc.cmu.edu!news.sei.cmu.edu!fs7.ece.cmu.edu!europa.eng.gtefsd.com!emory!ogicse!netnews.nwnet.net!news.u.washington.edu!news.u.washington.edu!ethanb\\\\nFrom: ethanb@ptolemy.astro.washington.edu (Ethan Bradford)\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space\\\\nSubject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters.

Clarke\\\\n\\\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\\\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\\\\nOrig. Ed. 1993\\\\nPre-publication $84.50\\\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\\\nreach them.   \\\\n\\\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\\\nreflections of their particular era\\'s dreams, abilities, and\\\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\\\n\\\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\\\n\\\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\\\n\\\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\\\nfictional\\\\n\\\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\\\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\\\\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\\\\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\\\\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\\\\narchives\\\\n\\\\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\\\\n\\\\nCONTENTS\\\\n\\\\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\\\\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\\\\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\\\\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\\\\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\\\\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\\\\n\\\\nABOUT RON MILLER\\\\n\\\\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I\\'ll try to hit the high\\\\nspots.]\\\\n\\\\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian\\'s\\\\nNational Air and Space Museum\\\\n\\\\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\\\\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\\\\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\\\\nSmithsonian* magazine\\\\n\\\\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\\\\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\\\\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\\\\n\\\\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \\\\n\\\\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\\\\n\\\\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\\\\n\\\\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\\\\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\\\\n\\\\nORDERING INFORMATION\\\\n\\\\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\\\\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\\\\n\\\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\\\nPO Box 9542\\\\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\\\\nUSA\\\\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\\\\nFax (407)951-3671\\\\n\\\\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\\\\nadditional book.  \\\\n\\\\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\\\\nadditional.

Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\\\\\\\GRBs\\\\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\\\\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\\\\n\\\\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\\\\\\\GRBs (the BATSE\\\\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\\\\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\\\\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\\\\n   between the angular distributions of \\\\\\\\GRBs and comets\\\\\\' aphelia,\\\\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\\\\n   at least to some extent, true variations\\\\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\\\\\\\vov$\\\\n   test to both distributions.\\\\n\\\\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\\\\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\\\\n   $\\\\\\\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\\\\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\\\\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\\\\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\\\\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\\\\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\\\\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\\\\\\\sim 800$\\\\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\\\\n   Currently,\\\\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\\\\n   found for the $\\\\\\\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\\\\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\\\\\\\GRBs.\\\\n\\'', '61404': 'b\\'Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu sci.astro:35223 sci.space:61404\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!das-news.harvard.edu!noc.near.net!howland.reston.ans.net!agate!ames!pan.arc.nasa.gov!moses\\\\nFrom: moses@pan.arc.nasa.gov (julie moses)\\\\nSubject: Re: temperature of the dark sky\\\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr28.185206.3501@news.arc.nasa.gov>\\\\nSender: usenet@news.arc.nasa.gov\\\\nOrganization: NASA-Ames Research Center\\\\nReferences: <C65o4t.A7o@zoo.toronto.edu> <1993Apr28.002214.16544@Princeton.EDU>\\\\nDate: Wed, 28 Apr 1993 18:52:06 GMT\\\\nLines: 29\\\\n\\\\n>> Does anyone have a reference (something I can look up, not just your own\\\\n>> recollections -- I have a few of those myself) on the temperature of the\\\\n>> (night) sky as seen from space?\\\\n>>\\\\n>> Note, I am *not* talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background\\\\n>> Radiation.

I think right now  it\\'s sitting  at 180 miles up,\\\\nthey would like  220.  I don\\'t know the exact orbit numbers.\\\\nI know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest\\\\npossible Shuttle orbit. \\\\n\\\\nNow the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended\\\\nduration orbiter pallet.  It\\'s mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells\\\\nand RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support\\\\nre-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.\\\\n\\\\nTHe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)\\\\nand Orbiter Duration.   \\\\n\\\\nIn order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines\\\\nwill be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy\\\\nthing.  THe HST isn\\'t light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel\\\\nneeded to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster\\\\ncarried up and used to boost HST on it\\'s own will weigh significantly\\\\nless then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,\\\\nfor a given orbital change.  \\\\n\\\\nFrom what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are\\\\ntight enough they can\\'t even carry extra Suits or MMU\\'s.\\\\n\\\\nNow if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,\\\\nthat the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the\\\\nEDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the\\\\nflaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,\\\\n\\\\nand still enough for a double magnum of champagne.\\\\n\\\\nor the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.\\\\nThe reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,\\\\nand longer drag life.\\\\n\\\\n|> and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables\\\\n|> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the\\\\n|> array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out\\\\n|\\\\n|From what I\\'ve heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two \\\\n|sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.

A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\\\\n\"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \\\\nthat\\\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\\\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\\\\\'s?) had a lot in\\\\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\\\\\\'s Daedalus project for sending a\\\\nprobe to Barnard\\\\\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\\\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\\\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\\\nrelatively great distance.\\\\n---\\\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\\\nthat planet\\\\\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\\\nsystems that weren\\\\\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\\\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\\\nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\\\\nplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\\\\ncourse. \\\\n\\\\nMARCU$\\\\n   \\\\n> ==\\\\n> Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I\\\\\\'m not high, just jacked\\\\n> \\\\n\\'', '61558': \"b'Path: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!das-news.harvard.edu!noc.near.net!uunet!digex.com!digex.net!not-for-mail\\\\nFrom: prb@access.digex.net (Pat)\\\\nNewsgroups: sci.space\\\\nSubject: Re: Combo Propulsion System!?\\\\nDate: 2 May 1993 15:08:02 -0400\\\\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications USA\\\\nLines: 10\\\\nMessage-ID: <1s166i$803@access.digex.net>\\\\nReferences: <1993May1.043916.1@aurora.alaska.edu> <C6DEMz.Bo9@zoo.toronto.edu>\\\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow difficult would it be to do a solar sail mission to say mercury?\\\\n\\\\nNot much has been there and there is a 23?KM/s delta v to eat off.\\\\n\\\\ncould a  solar sail, handle say adiscovery bus, and drop it into\\\\nmercury orbit,  good enough for rockets to put it into some\\\\nform of polar orbit?\\\\n\\\\npat\\\\n'\", '62319': 'b\\'Newsgroups: sci.space\\\\nPath: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!das-news.harvard.edu!noc.near.net!howland.reston.ans.net!newsserver.jvnc.net!yale.edu!nigel.msen.com!hela.iti.org!aws\\\\nFrom: aws@iti.org (Allen W.
